A mesh editor application in the style of Autodesk Maya or Blender.
Building upon knowledge of C++ and OpenGL, this is a half-edge data structure created from interlinked pointers and visualized mesh using OpenGL vertex buffers. Additionally implemented is a Catmull-Clark subdivision algorithm to smooth the meshes, and some simpler mesh editing operations as well.
